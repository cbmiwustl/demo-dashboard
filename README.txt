This repository contains the R code for the demonstration dashboard, which was designed by the 
Center for Biomedical Informatics at Washington University in St. Louis, using R programming language, 
and R packages: Shiny, rCharts and some others.

The dashboard is open for public viewing at this link: https://cbmiwustl.shinyapps.io/demo-dashboard/

Browser and Screen Recommendations
----------------------------------	 
This dashboard is fully compatible with Mozilla Firefox and Chrome browsers on a Windows machine, and 
Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, and Safari on a Mac machine. Optimal resolution is 1440x900 (but will display ok on others). 
Please expand the browser window for proper viewing of the dashboard.

**NOTE:**
There is slight difference in how the code will be displayed on shinyapps.io and on your local machine/Shiny Server, 
which is explained by platform differences. Please read the comments in the code to find out more.
